# print everything starting from the second line
tail -n+2 407228326.fasta

# count the sequence length: 
# remove character "newline" that divides the lines: tr -d 
# then count the number of characters in the file (skipping the first line): wc -c

# count the matches of sequence “ATGC” in E. coli's genome:
# remove the first line and removing newline characters: tr -d
# use grep to print out all occurrences of the sequence: grep -o "ATGC" 
# finally, count the number of occurrences: wc -l

# Darwin 


cd ~/introscicomp2014/UNIX/Data

# Remove the first 264 lines and the lines from 13900 onward 
## these lines contain Project Gutenberg data and the subject index
## can accomplish this by redirecting the output provided by the commands head and tail 
## read the documentations on these commands (man head) 
# Save the results in the file darwin.txt 

# count the original number of lines in otoos10.txt 
wc -l otoos10.txt  
# 15054 lines 

# first try the commands individually 
tail -n+265 otoos10.txt | wc -l  # should yield 14790 lines 
head --lines=-1155 otoos10.txt | wc -l  # should yield 13899 lines 

# first count the number of resulting lines before printing to darwin.txt 
# there should be 13899 - 264 = 13635 lines 
tail -n+265 otoos10.txt | head --lines=-1155 | wc -l 

# success! now print to darwin.txt 
tail -n+265 otoos10.txt | head --lines=-1155 > darwin.txt

# peek at the resulting file 
less darwin.txt


# Count the occurrences in darwin.txt of the terms "evolution" or "evolved", 
# appearing as full words and ignoring case.

# try grep to print out all occurrences of "evolution" or "evolved" 
grep -o -w -i 'evolution\|evolved' darwin.txt 

# now count the occurrences - 
grep -o -w -i 'evolution\|evolved' darwin.txt | wc -l  # 1 


# Count the occurrences of "natural selection" and "Wallace" 
grep -o -w -i 'natural selection' darwin.txt | wc -l  # 242

# temperatures of each station for Jan 1st from all the files
grep 180[0-3]0101,TMAX 180[0-3].csv | cut -d',' -f4


# Write a one-line command that finds the warmest temperature for a given day of 1800

# grep (extract max temperatures for each station on the day of interest), 
grep TMAX 1800.csv
# cut (extract the right column from the result of grep), 
cut -d',' -f4 1800.csv
# sort (to sort the results in ascending order), and 
sort -n 
# tail (to return only the maximum temperature)
tail -1 1800.csv

# now concatenate all 
grep TMAX 1800.csv | cut -d',' -f4 | sort -n | tail -1 

# The command should return 79 for February 5th and 225 for May 5th
grep 18000205,TMAX 1800.csv | cut -d',' -f4 | sort -n | tail -1  # 79
